Whack A Mole for Corsair RGB Keyboards

This is a re-write of Whack A Mole found at:
https://github.com/gweedo767/Keyboard-Whack-A-Mole

I switched it all over to the Corsair CUE SDK now.  It should supported all Corsair RGB Keyboards.  It has been tested on the K95 and 
Strafe at this time.

To play, just hit the "Enable" button.  Yellow keys are "Moles".  Hit them before they go away.  They will spawn faster the longer you
go.  Red keys on 1-0 are your life.  Each missed mole or wrong key hit will decrement that by one.  Your score is filled in purple
F keys.  Each key is worth 10 points.
